> **"The Best of All Time"** — A disruptive, enterprise-grade SEO platform engineered for high-scale ranking dominance.

RankForge AI is not just a tool; it's a **Neural SEO Ecosystem**. Built on the **Titan ML 2.10 Protocol**, it orchestrates a massive 12-step analysis pipeline to provide executive-level insights that industry giants (Ahrefs, SEMrush) struggle to match.

## 🚀 THE CORE INTELLIGENCE

RankForge AI utilizes a proprietary **Hybrid Neural Pipeline** that combines deep semantic analysis with real-time competitive benchmarking:

1.  **Stealth Neural Crawler**: High-concurrency Playwright engine with automated WAF bypass and isolated browser contexts.
2.  **Titan ML 2.10 Scorer**: Proprietary weighted algorithms (Title, Meta, H1, Content, Technical, Performance).
3.  **Expert Verdict Engine**: AI-driven executive summaries giving you the "ROI Move" for every page.
4.  **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**: Specialized analysis for search visibility in the AI Era (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini).
5.  **Multi-Tenant Archiving**: Enterprise-grade data isolation using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS).

## 🛠️ THE TECHNOLOGY STACK

RankForge AI is engineered with the most modern, high-performance stack available in 2026:

- **Frontend**: [Next.js 15 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/) — Ultra-fast, responsive, and styled with **Pure Black #000000 Mastery**.
- **Backend**: [FastAPI (Python 3.12)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) — Async/await architecture for non-blocking neural processing.
- **ML Layer**: [Titan ML 2.10](https://github.com/keerthivanan/SEO_core-) — Custom fine-tuned DistilBERT models + RL-driven Action Optimizers.
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL (via Supabase)](https://supabase.com/) — Scalable multi-tenant storage with enterprise hardening.
- **Infrastructure**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) — Containerized for seamless "One-Click" deployment.
